Welcome to Tal Perry's VBA Projects Showcase! I'm Tal Perry, a second-year Business Administration student at Laurier, and this repository serves as a platform for me to demonstrate my skills in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) through various projects. 
As I complete projects and develop my expertise in VBA, I'll be adding them here to showcase my progress and capabilities.
