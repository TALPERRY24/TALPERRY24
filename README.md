Welcome to Tal Perry's VBA Projects Showcase! I'm Tal Perry, a second-year Business Administration student at Laurier, and this repository serves as a platform for me to demonstrate my skills in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) through various projects. 
As I complete projects and develop my expertise in VBA, I'll be adding them here to showcase my progress and capabilities.

The student marking application zip file is one of the projects that best demonstrates my wide range of VBA capabilities, including getting information from Access databases using SQL, as well as creating charts, doing statistical analysis on data retrieved through SQL queries, and creating MS word reports summarizing that information.
